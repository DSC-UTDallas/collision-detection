# collision-detection

## Demo



## Summary



### Problem
Since red light cameras were recently banned in Texas, people may continue speeding to pass a red light signal, which is the cause of nearly 165,000 accidents. Furthermore, 50% of major collisions occur at intersections.

### Solution
Our solution is to prevent fatalities by detecting collisions from analyzing traffic cameras at intersections through machine learning; then, immediately notify alternate routes to nearby vehicles with the app in order to reduce traffic congestion, so that emergency vehicles can get to the scene as quickly as possible. 

For testing, we plan to use pre-recorded footage of collisions and deploy our mobile application to get feedback from users, which might include improvements to usability, intuitiveness, and interface. We also plan to use live traffic camera feeds and monitor the performance of our neural network. Existing infrastructure makes this idea readily applicable for future growth.
